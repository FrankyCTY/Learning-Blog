        Prototypal inheritance && class

        Why do we need the inheritance?
      </h3>
      <div class="page-content">
        <p>
          Using inheritance with either prototype or class allows us to save the
          memory usage of the code. It gives us
          <span class="clr-good">reusability</span> on the same piece of code
          and can also enhance the redability. (Although class will give us
          better redability and encapsulation, it is actually the prototype
          inheritance behind the scene.)

          <strong>What is prototype?</strong>

        <p>
          <span class="clr-good">__proto__</span> appears in every object
          (almost everything in javascript are object). As you can see from the
          above picture, we can see
          <span class="clr-good">__proto__</span> lives in the current object's
          prototype and it links to the above parent's prototype. It is like a
          <span class="clr-good">chain</span> that connects two objects together
          to create an inhertance.
        </p>

        <p class="clr-bad">
          __proto__ can be assigned directly to other object's prototype but it
          gives bad performance.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          <strong>I heard that objects do not have prototype?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Object has <span class="clr-good">__proto__</span> inside it but
          <span class="clr-bad">does not</span> contain any
          <span class="clr-bad">prototype</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="clr-good">functions</span> are the only thing that
          actually have prototype
          <span class="clr-good"
            >althought functions are also object at then end just like [].</span
          >
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          <span class="clr-good">Prototype</span> in functions can be used to
          create inheritance that can be inherited and saved to their prototype.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code>
                function a() {}

                a.prototype.go = function () {
                return "go go go!";
                };

                const b = a;

                console.log(b.prototype.go()); // inherited using its own __proto__ from a.prototype
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>objects can use <span class="clr-good">Object.create</span> to <span class="clr-good">create</span> object that is <span class="clr-good">inherited</span> from the other object.

        <pre>
            <code>
                let human = {
                    exist: true,
                    };
                    
                let john = Object.create(human);
                
                console.log(john);

        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="./img/object create.PNG" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>exist was actually the property in human</p>
        <p>After using Object.create() to create john, john will inherit human's properties and it will be saved in __proto__.</p>

        <p class="question">
            <strong>How to use prototype to create reusable code? <span class="clr-good">Constructor Function</span></strong>
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code>
                function Fighter(name, weapon) {
                    this.name = name;
                    this.weapon = weapon;
                }

                Fighter.prototype.fight = function() {
                    return `${this.name} is fighting with ${this.weapon}...`; //Why we don't put it into the constructor function?
                }

                const fighter0001 = new Fighter('fighter0001', 'sword');

                console.log(fighter0001.fight()); //Return -> fighter0001 is fighting with sword...
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p class="clr-good">Now we don't need to rewrite the code for any new 'instances'.</p>
        <p>It works because we use the <span class="clr-good">NEW</span> keyword, it will create an object from the constructor function. Remember that we have to use <span class="clr-good">THIS</span> keyword in the constructor function for inheritance.</p>


        <p><strong class="clr-bad" id="no-copy">//Why we don't put it into the constructor function?</strong></p>
        <p>The elements in the constructor function will be created each time we create an instance (object) with it. So since don't want to occupy to many spaces in the memory, we add the function into the prototype.</p>
        <p class="clr-bad">Unlike other oop languages like Java and C++, we can save memories in this way using prototype chain. But thats not the case in those languages.</p>
        <h3 class="page-subtitle">
            Class - the syntactic sugar
        </h3>

        <p>Javascript adopts prototype but it is actually not very readable expecially for the programmers from other languages.</p>
        <p>Thats why the javascript team added 'Classes' into it... But it actually runs under <span class="clr-good">prototype</span> behind the scene.</p>

        <pre>
            <code>
                class Fighter {
                    constructor(name, weapon) {
                        this.name = name;
                        this.weapon = weapon;
                    }

                    fight() {
                        return `${this.name} is fighting with ${this.weapon}...`; //Return -> fighter0002 is fighting with broken sword...
                    }
                }

                const fighter0002 = new Fighter('fighter0002', 'broken sword');

                console.log(fighter0002.fight());
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>It looks kinda alike the prototype inheritance with constructor function.</p>
        <p>But we can now encapsulate the method (fight()) into the same 'box' without using 'prototype' keyword outside the 'box'.</p>

        <p class="clr-good">Inheritance is all about object inherits from object and its all about __proto__ links to parent's prototype via the <span class="clr-bad">prototype chain.</span></p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="./img/prototype chain.PNG" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>In the picture, the Ogre is actually just a class that wraps a constructor function, <span class="clr-bad">constructor function itselfs doesn't give any inheritance power but it allows us to use NEW keyword to play with THIS keyword.</span></p>
        <p>The actually <span class="clr-bad">inheritance</span> we use on <span class="clr-bad">attack() or makeFort()</span> are happening in the <span class="clr-good">prototype chain</span>.</p>
        <p>And this is because we don't want the methods to be copied every time we create a new instance from the class (or say using the constructor function), thats why we use it outside of the constructor in the class <a href="#no-copy">(actually using prototype behind the scene)</a>.</p>
